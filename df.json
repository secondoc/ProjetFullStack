And they have since done everything in their power to deny the violent events that ironically happened in a \"Heavenly Peace Square\", down to cracking down a vigil that happened in Hong Kong last week. Or somehow comparing the events to the invasion of the U.S. Capitol in January, when that one didn't end with hundreds of unarmed civilians being shot dead."],"1":["Because people need something to compare #8 to. Though why 2012 got more views than 2016? Well, it probably has to do with how before Tokyo (#1), London was India's (#4) best performance."],"2":["With #8, we wanted to remind themselves of what happened last time out."],"3":["Two years ago, the Liberals didn't get a majority in the parliament. They tried again this year (#5), and still couldn't."],"4":["The opening ceremonies are scheduled for July 23. The games were planned to showcase how Japan bounced back from the 2011 tsunami, but instead became overshadowed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has so far pushed back the games by a year, caused a regional lockdown weeks before the opening, and prompted the creation of a condom-free-but-probably-not-sex-free Olympic village. Doesn't help that in spite of being one body of water away from the pandemic's origin, Japan took very long to start vaccinating its population and now the populace is afraid of a COVID resurgence.","Sports fans now will spend two weeks in the very unfavorable Japan Standard Time to see the multi-sport event that started in spite of the goddamned  pandemic delaying it for a year (and the protests of a populace that started immunizing itself too late). One of #1's teammates, Jordan Nwora, will compete for the Nigerian basketball team - Giannis' Greece certainly missed him as they couldn't qualify.","Sports fans of the New World (and maybe a few of the Old one as well) are currently sleep-deprived to fit into the Tokyo Standard Time where the biggest multi-sport event is happening. The pandemic that delayed the Olympics is still having its effects felt, with medalists forced to wear masks on the podium and such.","One more week where sports fans supported their countries from a distance, even in host city Tokyo as the same pandemic that delayed it for a year forced events without outsiders or reduced crowds. The Games closed on the Sunday this Report was published, to the relief of those who are losing their sleep to watch events late at night.  At least the next ones are only three years away and the winter one is 6 months from now!","An iconic talk show host whose career spanned over six decades, King passed away on Saturday last week, earning him a higher spot this week."],"5":["Viewers around the world were frustrated by how the opening ceremony of #2 ordered countries in the Japanese alphabet - for instance, Brazil is 28th listed in English, but 151st in this system. On a more positive note, geeky sports fans could appreciate how the soundtrack to the parade was orchestral versions of video game music."],"6":["Who is the most successful country at these games? If gold medals are the standard, it's China. If overall medals is the way, it's the United States. (you might notice US media always shifts standards when the country lags behind...) In other news, San Marino and Turkmenistan got their first medals of any colour and Bermuda and the Philippines take their first golds. Bermuda and San Marino are the smallest countries to achieve those respective accomplishments (in terms of population).","Americans had gone rogue and started sorting tables by most medals in an apparent attempt to claim you're better than you actually are. And then in the last day the USA gets a few golds - including one very painful for one of the writers here - to still finish at the top, to the chagrin of every other country. This week also saw Burkina Faso win their first medal at the Olympics, in the Men's triple jump. And like in 2016, the previous host country managed to get more medals than when they had athletes in every sport!"],"7":["Back to sports popular in India, namely badminton, with a biennial national team tournament having the edition that should've happened last year, and victories for Indonesian men and Chinese women."],"8":["All the terrible things that happened in Washington (#5) were because the American voter made clear they did not want a Trump (#7) re-election, but he's a sore loser and his fans are a particularly explosive bunch."],"9":["Unlike 2003, this time California chose not to get rid of its governor. Maybe it was a lack of a recall candidate comparable to Arnold Schwarzenegger?"],"10":["\"There's an election happening, and it's called a snap election because it was called three minutes ago and ends in a hot second, unlike an American election, which lasts about 597 days.\" Indeed, one month after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau asked for a dissolution of the Parliament, Canada already chose its House of Commons representatives again. Trudeau's Liberals still came out on top."],"11":["Across the sea, South America has its equivalent of #2, albeit one that hosts Brazil are not exactly embracing even if they love the sport - when the moron in the presidency jumps right in at the opportunity to host a football tournament once Argentina backs out, while he barely does anything to contain the goddamned pandemic (including ignoring\\refusing several offers of vaccines that led to a still slow immunization), you bet the populace won't be happy at these skewed priorities.","Unlike #1, the South American football tournament of nations is being played before empty stadiums. Blame it on the president currently ruining host country Brazil, as he ensured COVID-19 vaccination started late and lacking resources - to make matters worse, over 100 people related to the Copa Am\u00e9rica teams have tested positive.","South America's equivalent of #1, which since the 90s  has brought guests from North\\Central America (or, in a geographical oddity,  Asia!), with this year showing why, as restricting to Conmebol's 10 teams means a long group stage where only two don't qualify to the knockout rounds. And the least we discuss about how it's only being held in Brazil because its government has very skewed priorities, the better.","If the national team loses to its archenemy at its own home and it's not considered a national tragedy, you can tell people were not very approving of the tournament. Blame it on a government that makes little of a pandemic that took half a million lives while jumping in at the opportunity of hosting a football championship."],"12":["Elections were held on September 26, though no coalition has been formed yet. Regardless of who gets a majority, Angela Merkel will be stepping down as chancellor. She held the office for almost 16 years, only lagging behind the guy who united Germany and the guy who reunited Germany."],"13":["And back to sports in Arabia, namely a cricket tournament that the UAE and Oman took on as India had to be separated from their national pastime due to the pandemic (and even then, Oman nearly lost its stadium when Cyclone Shaheen hit a few weeks ago)."],"14":["While on sports in Garfield's preferred destination for sending cute kittens (plus two other United Arab Emirates and the capital of Oman), a less violent alternative to #12 in the latest edition of #9."],"15":["One sad certainty about the Middle East is that whenever it seems like things calmed down, there will always emerge something to break the peace.","A truce was declared following 15 days of violence on the latest Middle-Eastern conflict - which included bombings in one of two tracts of land owned by Palestine, a Mediterranean territory slightly smaller than Las Vegas. Apparently it isn't really holding, no matter who you get your news from."],"16":["American football got its latest college athletes, with the Jacksonville Jaguars using their #1 pick on Trevor Lawrence."],"17":["The left-wing Pedro Castillo narrowly beat the right-wing Keiko Fujimori on June 6. Fujimori has refused to concede, alleging fraud. This might seem like a replay of what happened in Bolivia two years ago, but look at it this way: it's not that bad yet."],"18":["Badminton's equivalent of the Davis Cup. The high views probably owe to the sport's popularity in India, even if the country fell in the group stage (neigbour China took it all, given they're as dominating in \"tennis with a shuttlecock\" as in table tennis)."],"19":["A combination of a dust storm and high winds made #4 run aground and be stuck horizontally on #2, creating a \"boat traffic jam\" as   over 300 ships had to wait to pass through.

All India Trinamool Congress (AITC) increased their majority. The election was marred by violence, with opposition parties claiming the violence was conducted by the AITC against them."],"23":["The final procedure of a United States presidential election is the certification of Electoral College votes by Congress. This is a ceremonial procedure, and elections are rarely decided at this stage. President Trump held a rally outside of Congress on January 6, the day of the certification. Trump left in the morning; at 2:15 p.m., barricades around the Capitol building were breached by protestors, and Congresspeople were evacuated to a bunker soon after. Protestors were mostly interested in taking photos for social media, and were removed soon after.While only 13 were arrested on the day of the storming, several have been arrested after the fact; this includes a W.V. state delegate that livestreamed the breach, the guy that stole Nancy Pelosi's lectern, and the \"QAnon\" shaman. ","Why does Antifa wear masks? For the most part, it's so that police can't identify them. If you wanted to commit a crime - such as rioting in the United States Capitol - you probably shouldn't pose for photos, get caught on a livestream, or identify yourself to the media afterwards."],"24":["Following the group draw of Europe's premier club championship and his transfer, #1 changed his group from one against defending champion Chelsea FC to one with defending UEFA Europa League champion Villareal CF, which he regularly beat when he was with Real Madrid."],"25":["Now all national football teams will focus on qualifying for next year's edition of #22 - the last one with a manageable 32 teams, before it bloats to 48. Better appreciate that instead of remembering the host country has no football tradition and is so hot that the games will happen in November-December so the players don't boil alive."],"26":["The first country to join hosts (still weird to say it) Qatar are four-time champions Germany, making Die Mannschaft's fans hopeful they won't embarrass themselves like in Russia 2018 (although the successful qualifying campaign included a defeat to North Macedonia, so all bets are off for how it'll go). UEFA Euro 2020 semifinalists Denmark also punched their ticket, and more squads should get in by the next round on November 11."],"27":["The annual music awards were held with a different approach, featuring both pre-recorded and live performances, nominees actually at the Los Angeles Convention Center or attending virtually, etc. Beyonc\u00e9 took home four awards, Taylor Swift had Album of the Year for Folklore and a standout of the night was English singer Dua Lipa, who got Best Pop Vocal Album for Future Nostalgia and had a show-stopping, sensuous performance."],"28":["One of many annual TV and film award shows was held remotely on Sunday night."],"29":["2020 was a terrible year for the film business, and yet had enough good movies (although with an extended window that only ended in February!), many of whom are now contending for cinema's top prize. Mank having the most nominations shows the Academy still has something for movies about film production.","The goddamned pandemic derailed the film industry, yet AMPAS still decided to award the best productions of 2020 (and early 2021). One of the major jibes before the ceremony got started was its choice of main location, a train station (pictured), and it only got worse from there. The Oscars, adamantly refusing to use Zoom (or similar) after the less than successful early awards ceremonies, was in-person only, though they added hubs in London and Paris so nominees that didn't want to (or, couldn't) go to Los Angeles could attend. It certainly felt more like the Golden Globes in a normal year with its audience at tables and such. Except they weren't drunk, nor particularly excited. The screen ban also meant there were no clips played before categories, and both the hosts and the In Memoriam seemed to be rushing to get home. So, between the average moviegoer having not seen the nominees and and a fairly uninteresting ceremony, it translated into the lowest ratings ever."],"30":["The big release of the week all theaters closed last year is finally available! And this here writer just prays there are film screens near him again when his country gets it in mid-June, as he just can't wait to be reunited with Emily Blunt in a post-apocalyptic world dominated by beasts who hate loud noises.","Shh! The John Krasinski-directed horror flick A Quiet Place, about a family (led by himself and real life wife Emily Blunt) who must live their lives in silence to avoid killer aliens with amazing hearing, earned itself critical and audience acclaim as well as beaucoup bucks. It got itself a sequel, but does anyone else kind of hate it when they just slap \"Part 2\" in front of things? It could've been A Quieter Place, or A Quiet Place: Hold Your Breath, or A Quiet Place: Shut the Fuck Up. In any case, Jim Halpert seems to have avoided the sophomore slump with this one if online ratings are to be believed.","In the post-apocalyptic world of this movie, the enemy is a race of extraterrestrial monsters who hate loud noises. In the near-apocalyptic one we live in, it is a virus that postponed the premiere of the film by a year and ensured not all theaters are open to show it."],"31":["After 35 years apart, the iconic Swedish pop group that even had its songs in a musical, itself adapted into two movies, announced a reunion album and a concert residency in London, which will instead of musicians in their seventies feature musicians in the Seventies - namely virtual recreations of ABBA in the period, described as ABBAtars."],"32":["Aaliyah, an R&B singer, died at the age of 22 on August 25, 2001.

Omar was the one who ruled Afghanistan after the group turned it into a fundamentalist state (#3), up until it was taken down by the Americans, and also led the insurrection against NATO forces until he died in 2013 of tuberculosis. Baradar (pictured) held various jobs during that government, was captured by the CIA in 2010, released eight years later to serve in Taliban's diplomatic office, and is expected to be the Afghan president following the new Taliban takeover."],"34":["#13's co-star in Sex\/Life, as well as her boyfriend. Thanks to him we don't have to discuss the horrors of #26 NXIVM."],"35":["Looks like we finally got a hello from the other side. As soon as the performer of one of James Bond's most acclaimed theme songs got divorced, jokes flew that all was set for another heartbreak album that would sweep charts and awards. And now it's officially coming, as Adele announced fourth record 30 (which again is titled after the age she was at the start of production) will be released in November, while also issuing lead single \"Easy on Me\", which broke plenty of single-day streaming records before the day was even over and will undoubtedly be sitting pretty atop charts across the globe.","The reigning queen of blue-eyed soul may have released her first single in almost five years last week, and her album may not be out for another four weeks, but did anyone really expect for Adele's world domination to be over with that quickly? After Adele released yet another critically acclaimed ballad in the form of \"Easy on Me\", the song broke streaming records and topped almost all of the charts that it appeared on this week. Meanwhile, her fourth studio album, 30, about her divorce and motherhood, is set to be released in less than a month and will also likely cause the world to stop."],"36":["In all likelihood, it'll soon be under the control of #6.","A groundbreaking African-American actress with an acclaimed seven decade career, receiving many awards along the way, Tyson passed away at the age of 96.","The NATO-led evacuation of foreign nationals from Afghanistan was interrupted by a suicide bombing at the NATO-controlled Hamid Karzai International Airport on Thursday. The current death count is at 182, including 13 members of the U.S. military. Some American political figures are, in light of this, pushing for President Biden to either move up the troops-leaving-deadline or to simply restart the war; it seems that the guy who literally just pulled out of Afghanistan isn't eager to go right back in.","The transition back to Islamic fundamentalism (#20) has understandably brought in tears and blood."],"37":["An iconic talk show host whose career spanned over six decades, King passed away on Saturday last week, earning him a higher spot this week.","#2's main antagonist, a witch played  by Kathryn Hahn, who in the first episodes was disguised as Wanda's nosy neighbor Agnes."],"38":["Challenor used to be an activist working with England's Green Party and later the Liberal Democrats, but left the country after two separate controversies concerning pedophilia.

Do they not realise that this adds fuel to the anti-semitism fire?"],"40":["And back to Afghanistan, namely the ones who led the Americans to invade the country 20 years ago (#10) after attacking New York and Washington with three planes (almost four).

Basically, expect to see it on the list for weeks to come.","Scarlet Witch and Vision relive moments out of old sitcoms that are clearly an illusion of sorts in the return of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, only not in theaters, but a Disney+ show.","After inserting the Scarlet Witch and Vision into pastiches of I Love Lucy, Bewitched and The Brady Bunch, Disney+ finally decided to offer some explanations as for what was happening, while giving a proper introduction to Monica Rambeau and the organization SWORD, and bringing back actors Kat Dennings and Randall Park from the movies.","The first Marvel Cinematic Universe show on Disney+ continues to surprise viewers, this time with a very unexpected cameo.","Hopefully those who didn't like the first three episodes for being sendoffs to old sitcoms remained to see how the show is now about a dangerous grieving superpowered women trapping a town in sendoffs to old sitcoms.","This Disney+ series, the first installment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe since 2019, has delivered week after week of twists - the latest being the introduction of a clear antagonist.","Along with digging deeper into what led to all those sitcom pastiches, this week's episode marked a first in the Marvel Cinematic Universe: Wanda Maximoff was finally referred to as Scarlet Witch!","This Disney+ original series released its finale on Friday. While WandaVision started out as a mysterious \"Lynchian\" sitcom, it eventually devolved into an MCU action film - but what were you really expecting?","The final episode aired last week, which means that the Report has a brief respite from weekly Marvel movies (brief being the operative word - The Falcon and the Winter Soldier airs its first episode next week.)","Marvel's foray into Disney+ was supposed to start with the straightforward superheroism of #8.

The first episode is a counterfactual on the 2011 Captain America film, with Steve Rogers's British girlfriend taking the super serum instead (something that originated in a mobile game), and Rogers being given a dieselpunk Iron Man suit.","After one week off, even if it marked the last time featuring Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther, the Disney+ animated version of Marvel's Elseworlds bounces back following an episode reminiscent of the most pessimistic issues of the original comics, revolving around the Avengers dying before they could even assemble.","Continuing the downbeat thread of last week's alternate Marvel Cinematic Universe history, this time reimagining Doctor Strange, only the doctor-turned-sorcerer becomes a power hungry abomination for not taking well the death of Rachel McAdams.","This time, the Marvel Cinematic Universe animated anthology series went zombies.","Fans of Michael B. Jordan's Erik Killmonger could meet him again in the MCU's alternate history cartoon. And this time any sympathy he had in Black Panther is absent, as after preventing the events of Iron Man Killmonger turns out to be a manipulative bastard who derails everything in his revenge campaign.","After three bleak episodes, Marvel's animated anthology delivered a comedic alternate history where by being raised alone instead of with a backstabbing brother, Thor grows up to become a party animal whose arrival on Earth leads to wacky hijinks.","Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings fell of the list, but the Marvel Cinematic Universe (the only series with as many movies as #9) keeps itself on the Report through what was supposedly an anthology but got an overarching villain, as homicidal robot Ultron got the Infinity Stones from Thanos and decided to outclass him, wiping out all life from his universe! And he discovers there is a multiverse, hence Uatu (voiced by one of #2's actors) is forced to not be just a Watcher before everyone is subjected to an Age of Ultron.","Marvel's animated alternate history ended its first season by assembling characters from all previous eight episodes... plus a ninth that ended up postponed for a second season, and for a change wouldn't have Iron Man dying.

It's received mostly positive reviews and enough attention to finally knock that goddamned game which I won't mention again out of Netflix's coveted number one spot.

Some fans were convinced that the \"Snyder cut,\" which surely existed somewhere, was far better than the lackluster Whedon version. However, due to the way effects-heavy superhero films are produced, the cut was probably far from complete (Folding Ideas has a good video about why.) After $70 million of effects and reshoots, the Snyder cut is finally complete - with a trailer dropping this last Sunday.","All the cries of #ReleaseTheSnyderCut were filled, at the asking price of an HBO Max subscription and 4 hours to kill. Reviews were positive, even if the indulgent nature of this superhero project (again: the thing lasts 4 hours!) is a contentious point.","On one hand, the film is more consistent and the added content fleshes out characters such as Cyborg and Steppenwolf. On the other hand, it's also consistently too grim (the washed colors and moody soundtrack help) and the amount of slow motion is abusive. Still, a valid if overlong effort. Now let's see what lies ahead, even if fans aren't ready to move on (#21).","Fans are now griping #RestoreTheSnyderverse given the extended cut of Justice League was released, but Warner Bros. won't continue it.
