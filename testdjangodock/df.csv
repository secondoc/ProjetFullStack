However, heartthrobs like Harry hooking up with honeys like her has hearts breaking. More specifically, if the tabloid fodder is to be believed, Styles may have been the reason for the House star's breakup with former fiancé and SNL alum Jason Sudeikis, and now he's falling again. That last one was pretty bad, but the bottom line is that the star of possibly the goofiest movie to ever take itself seriously (that I watched when I was 10 and ran out of the theatre scared of) will most definitely be making a subtle appearance in the lyrics of a hit song some time soon, as Styles, like his former sweetheart Taylor Swift, has a penchant for infusing his personal relationships into his music.",C-Class article
